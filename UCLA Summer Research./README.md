These three codes are three different functions that simulate:

1. The interaction between a partciles in a small lattice array of particles (i.e. 7-by-7-by-7)

2. The interaction between a partciles in a big lattice array of particles, the actual size(i.e. 7-by-50-by-50)

3. The magnetic momentum on the surface of the larger lattice array.

All three functions have been coded by me and my research partner, Michael Hernandez from University of Texas, Austin
